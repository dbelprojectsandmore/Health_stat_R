summary(glm(target ~ thal, data = Heart, family = binomial))


```
Best single statistically significant association between target and a  categorical variables is for thal. with a p-value of 2.2e-16 which is statistically significant at the 99.9 confidence interval, and the correlation has a strength of 0.54
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Heart, aes(thalf, fill= Disease)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs( x="Results of the blood flow", y="Number of patients")


```

Logistic regression using multiple categorical variables

First using all the categorical variables available and then using only those that are statistically significant and finally a model that takes into account the interaction between thal and ca.


```{r}
summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+restecg+fbs+sex, data = Heart, family = binomial))

summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+sex, data = Heart, family = binomial))

summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+sex+thal*ca, data = Heart, family = binomial))




```


Logistic Regression using one continous variables- we see that the statistically significant variables for predicting heart disease are: age,thalach, and oldpeak 

We then combine the variables into a multiple logistic regression test taking into account the interaction between age and thalach


```{r}


summary(aov(Heart$target ~ Heart$ï..age))
summary(aov(Heart$target ~ Heart$trestbps))
summary(aov(Heart$target ~ Heart$chol))
summary(aov(Heart$target ~ Heart$thalach))
summary(aov(Heart$target ~ Heart$oldpeak))




summary(glm(target ~ oldpeak+thalach+ï..age+thalach*ï..age, data = Heart, family = binomial))
```
```{r}


ggplot(Heart, aes(x= ï..age,col= Disease)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=oldpeak)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=thalach/-50))+
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*-50, name = "thalach"))+
  geom_abline()
  labs( x="age", y="oldpeak")
  
  
  
```
The above graph shows both oldpeak(y-axis on the left) and oldpeak (y axis on the right) in terms of age. The data points for oldpeak are on the top half of the graph, while the datapoints for thalach are on the bottom portion of the graph,


Finally we take a look at a combined model featuring all the categorical and continuous variables available. We then try the same model taking into account interactions between thal and ca as well as between exang and cp. We also take a model which only uses the statstically signinficant variables we found earlier, settling on a model that takes into account interaction between thal and ca.



```{r}
summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+restecg+fbs+sex+oldpeak+thalach+ï..age+trestbps+chol, data = Heart, family = binomial))

summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+restecg+fbs+sex+oldpeak+thalach+ï..age+trestbps+chol+thal*ca+exang*cp, data = Heart, family = binomial))


summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+sex+oldpeak+thalach+trestbps, data = Heart, family = binomial))

summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+sex+oldpeak+thalach+trestbps+thal*ca+exang*cp, data = Heart, family = binomial))

summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+sex+oldpeak+thalach+trestbps+thal*ca, data = Heart, family = binomial))
```


```{r}


summary(glm(target ~ oldpeak+thalach+ca+cp+thal+exang+sex, data = Heart, family = binomial))


summary(glm(target ~ oldpeak+thalach+ca+cp+thal+exang+slope, data = Heart, family = binomial))
summary(glm(target ~ oldpeak+thalach+ca+cp+thal+exang, data = Heart, family = binomial))

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
