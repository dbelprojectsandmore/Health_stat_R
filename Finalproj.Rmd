```
Best single statistically significant association between target and a  categorical variables is for thal. with a p-value of 2.2e-16 which is statistically significant at the 99.9 confidence interval, and the correlation has a strength of 0.54. 

When we use thal as our predictor variable we end up with the regression model p(y) = 3.2016-1.2916x

where p(y) is the probability of NOT developing heart disease, 3.2016 is the y-intercept, and -12916 is the slope.

It's important to note that the higher the probability the more likely the person is NOT to have heart disease as the target is codded as 1= no disease, and 0 = disease. This is reflected in the first graph as the probability of NOT developing disease drops as we move towards having a non-fixed reversible defect.
```{r}
plot(Heart$thal,Heart$target,xlab="thal",ylab="Probability of No Disease")
g=(glm(target ~ thal, data = Heart, family = binomial)) 

curve(predict(g,data.frame(thal=x),type ='resp'),add=TRUE) # draws a curve based on prediction from logistic regression model



library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Heart, aes(thalf, fill= Disease)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs( x="Results of the blood flow", y="Number of patients")


```

Logistic regression using multiple categorical variables

First using all the categorical variables available and then using only those that are statistically significant and finally a model that takes into account the interaction between thal and ca.


We see that the model using all categorical variables has 2 variables that are not statistically significant for our model. When we drop these two variables our model contains only significant variables. 

The final model with the interaction between thal and ca is:

p(y) = 2.5881-1.3045(thal)-2.1776(ca)+1.3240(slope)-1.2897(exang)+0.8574(cp)-1.4253(sex)+0.5665(that)(ca)

This is the best model that only uses categorical variables as it contains all statistically significant variables as well as account for interaction between factors.

Logistic Regression using one continous variables- we see that the statistically significant variables for predicting heart disease are: age,thalach, and oldpeak - with the single best predictor being oldpeak ( p-value of 4.09e-15 ***)

We then combine the three variables into a multiple logistic regression test taking into account the interaction between age and thalach.

The resulting model is : p(y) = 0.1716(thalach)+0.3627(age)-0.7531(oldpeak)-0.00249(thalach)(age)-24.31

summary(aov(Heart$target ~ Heart$oldpeak))


summary(glm(target ~ oldpeak, data = Heart, family = binomial))
summary(glm(target ~ oldpeak+thalach+ï..age+thalach*ï..age, data = Heart, family = binomial))

summary(glm(target ~ oldpeak+thalach+ï..age+thalach*ï..age, data = Heart, family = binomial))
```
Probability of NO disease decreases as age increase
```{r}
plot(Heart$ï..age,Heart$target,xlab="age",ylab="Probability of NO Disease")
g=(glm(target ~ ï..age, data = Heart, family = binomial)) 

curve(predict(g,data.frame(ï..age=x), type='resp'),add=TRUE) # draws a curve based on prediction from logistic regression model
```
Probability of no disease drops as oldpeak increase

```{r}
plot(Heart$oldpeak,Heart$target,xlab="oldpeak",ylab="Probability of NO Disease")
g=(glm(target ~ oldpeak, data = Heart, family = binomial)) # run a logistic regression model (in this case, generalized linear model with logit link). see ?glm
curve(predict(g,data.frame(oldpeak=x), type='resp'),add=TRUE) # draws a curve based on prediction from logistic regression model
```
Probability of NO disease increases as thalach level increase
```{r}
plot(Heart$thalach,Heart$target,xlab="thlach level",ylab="Probability of NO Disease")
g=(glm(target ~ thalach, data = Heart, family = binomial)) 
curve(predict(g,data.frame(thalach=x), type='resp'),add=TRUE) # draws a curve based on prediction from logistic regression model
```


```{r}


ggplot(Heart, aes(x= ï..age,col= Disease)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=oldpeak)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=thalach/-50))+
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*-50, name = "thalach"))+
  geom_abline()
  labs( x="age", y="oldpeak")
  
  
  
```
The above graph shows both oldpeak(y-axis on the left) and oldpeak (y axis on the right) in terms of age. The data points for oldpeak are on the top half of the graph, while the datapoints for thalach are on the bottom portion of the graph,


Finally we take a look at a combined model featuring all the categorical and continuous variables available. We then   try  a model which only uses the statstically signinficant variables we found earlier, we use this settling on a model that takes into account interaction between thal and ca

The resulting model is: 3.395429-1.354833(thal)-2.371512(ca)+0.665827(slope)-0.910823(exang)+0.093924(cp)-1.621221(sex)-0.588705(oldpeak)+0.023139(thalach)-0.021921(trstbps)+0.698071(thal(ca))






```{r}
summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+restecg+fbs+sex+oldpeak+thalach+ï..age+trestbps+chol, data = Heart, family = binomial))



summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+sex+oldpeak+thalach+trestbps, data = Heart, family = binomial))


summary(glm(target ~ thal+ca+slope+exang+cp+sex+oldpeak+thalach+trestbps+thal*ca, data = Heart, family = binomial))
